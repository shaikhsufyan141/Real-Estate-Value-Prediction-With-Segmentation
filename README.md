# Real-Estate-Value-Prediction-With-Segmentation

### Suppose there is an investment fund planning to invest in properties at hundreds of locations. 🏠 Based on the previous millions of property sales over the past few years, the fund house wants to identify the property which can result in a higher gain on investment. 💰 They can not go by analyzing all the properties one by one. 🤔 So they want the segmentation of properties so that they can look into their target segments. 🎯 So this challenge is going to help them by easily identifying their target properties using advanced AI and Analytics. 🔍

### In the first week, you will receive a dataset of real estate properties with locality, estimated price, and selling price for the last 23 years. 📊 The task is to identify the input features in the dataset and use them to predict the sale price of a property. 🔮 After this modelling of input and output features, predict the sale price of all the properties in the test dataset. 💵 Once the sale prices for the test data are predicted, put these properties into 4 segments. 🔢 These segments can be formed according to the gain. 💹 The gain is calculated based on the estimated price and predicted sale price (Gain = (Sale price - Estimated price)/100).
